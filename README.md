# ircc-pdf-filler-vue
This project was supposed to be a small replacement for Adobe Reader for IRCC related documents until I realized the IRCC's application doesn't scan the PDF417 barcodes on the form. As a result, this project is discontinued. This one doesn't generate barcodes because it was the last thing I was going to do, but now that I abandoned the project, I didn't even tidy up the code.

### Motivation
Many IRCC applications requires at least filling 2 forms. Many forms are almost the same. Filling the same information can get pretty annoying. So I tried to automate it. The program remember your info and populate to other forms.
